LL#4: Responsive Rescue — TasteBuds Edition
🧁 Today, you're teaming up to fix a food blog!
Salma from TasteBuds, a cozy global recipe site, needs help! Her homepage looks decent on desktop, but breaks on mobile. Your dev team has been hired to make it beautifully responsive using CSS Flexbox and media queries.

You’ll debug layout issues, use media queries to adapt the design, and work as a dev shop solving a real(ish) client problem.
